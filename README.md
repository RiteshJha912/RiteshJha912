What's up, folks? Ritesh Jha here, coming at you with that relentless mindset. Let me tell you a little something about myself. I'm a college student, grinding away at my B.Tech in Information Technology. But let me make one thing crystal clear â€“ I'm not just another student. I'm all about pushing my limits, breaking barriers, and embracing the pain. You see, I've got this burning passion for web development, cybersec,coding â€“ you name it. But what really gets my heart racing? Challenges. Yeah, you heard me right. I thrive on 'em. 
So buckle up, because when I set my mind to something, there's no stopping me.
